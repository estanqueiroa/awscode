# To report an exposed S3 bucket to AWS, you can follow these official channels:

1. AWS Vulnerability Reporting Program:
   - Visit: https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/
   - Email: aws-security@amazon.com

2. AWS Security Contact Form:
   - Go to: https://hackerone.com/aws_vdp/
   - Click on "Submit report"

## When reporting, include:
- The bucket name
- Any evidence of public accessibility
- Screenshots (if applicable)
- How you discovered the exposure
- Your contact information
- The date you discovered the issue

## Important guidelines:
- DON'T download or modify any data
- DON'T share the bucket details publicly
- DON'T attempt to contact the bucket owner directly
- DO report it promptly
- DO be clear and professional in your report
- DO maintain confidentiality

**Remember**: Public access to an S3 bucket doesn't automatically mean it's a security issue - some buckets are intentionally public (like those hosting website content). Only report buckets that appear to be unintentionally exposed with sensitive content.

AWS will review the report and contact the bucket owner if necessary while maintaining your anonymity.
