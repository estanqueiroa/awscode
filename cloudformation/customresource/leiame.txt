# Unlocking IaC Flexibility with AWS CloudFormation Custom Resources

AWS CloudFormation is a powerful tool for Infrastructure as Code (IaC), allowing you to manage your AWS resources in a declarative and version-controlled manner. However, there are times when the built-in CloudFormation resource types may not be sufficient to meet your specific requirements. This is where CloudFormation custom resources come into play.



## What are CloudFormation Custom Resources?
CloudFormation custom resources are a way to extend the functionality of CloudFormation by allowing you to create your own resource types. These custom resources can interact with any service, both within AWS and outside of it, enabling you to automate tasks and integrate your CloudFormation stacks with external systems.

## When to Use CloudFormation Custom Resources?
There are several scenarios where CloudFormation custom resources can be particularly useful:

1. **Interacting with External Services**: If you need to interact with a service or system that is not natively supported by CloudFormation, you can create a custom resource to handle the integration.

2. **Performing Complex Validations**: CloudFormation's built-in validations may not be sufficient for your use case. Custom resources can help you perform more complex validations before creating or updating resources.

3. **Generating Dynamic Resource Names or IDs**: If you need to generate unique resource names or IDs based on specific criteria, custom resources can help you achieve this.

4. **Integrating with Third-Party Tools**: You can use custom resources to integrate your CloudFormation stacks with third-party tools, such as monitoring or ticketing systems.

## How to Create a CloudFormation Custom Resource?
Creating a CloudFormation custom resource typically involves the following steps:

1. **Define the Custom Resource**: In your CloudFormation template, you define a custom resource using the `AWS::CloudFormation::CustomResource` resource type. This includes specifying the provider and the properties required by your custom resource.

2. **Implement the Custom Resource Logic**: You will need to create a Lambda function or a third-party service that can handle the create, update, and delete operations for your custom resource. This implementation should follow the expected contract for CloudFormation custom resources.

3. **Handle the Custom Resource Lifecycle**: Your custom resource implementation must be able to handle the create, update, and delete operations, as well as respond to CloudFormation's requests with the appropriate data and status.

4. **Test and Deploy**: Thoroughly test your custom resource implementation, and then deploy it along with your CloudFormation stack.

## Example: Custom Resource for Tagging a VPC endpoint

Let's consider an example of a custom resource that add tags to VPC endpoints.

You can deploy the stack with this template using the CloudFormation console, AWS CLI, Rain or your preferred method.

To use this custom resource in your CloudFormation template, you would define a AWS::CloudFormation::CustomResource resource with the appropriate VpcEndpointIds and Tags properties, and the VpcEndpointTaggerFunction Lambda function would handle the tagging operation.

When the stack is created, CloudFormation will invoke the custom resource Lambda function to create the VPC endpoints tags with the specified configuration.

Please note that this is a basic example, and you may need to add additional parameters validation, error handling, logging, and other features to make it more robust and production-ready.


## Conclusion
CloudFormation custom resources are a powerful tool that can help you extend the capabilities of CloudFormation to meet your specific requirements. By leveraging custom resources, you can automate complex tasks, integrate with external systems, and create more flexible and dynamic infrastructure deployments. As you embrace the power of custom resources, you'll unlock new possibilities for managing your AWS environment with CloudFormation.
