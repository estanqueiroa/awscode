Description: "Stop and start Amazon EC2 instances at regular intervals using Lambda based on TAG"

WARNING: This solution will implement AWS services which may have associated costs - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK :-)

AWS Services to be created: Lambda, IAM role, EventBridge.

# Short Description

You can use AWS Lambda and Amazon EventBridge to automatically stop and start EC2 instances based on tag to save running costs.

Note: The following resolution is a simple solution based on this post https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/start-stop-lambda-eventbridge

For a more advanced solution, use the AWS Instance Scheduler. For more information, please see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/instance-scheduler-on-aws/solution-overview.html

# How It Works

Tag the in-scope EC2 instances with:

Tag Key = ec2scheduler
Tag Value = yes

After solution deployment (steps below), AWS Lambda function and Amazon EventBridge will automatically stop and start the tagged EC2 instances on the scheduled time.

# Prerequisites

1) An Amazon Web Services (AWS) account with privileges to deploy AWS components listed on the solutions.

https://catalog.workshops.aws/cfn101/en-US/prerequisites/account

2) (Optional) Install and configure the AWS CLI version 2 

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html

3) Create CloudFormation (CFN) stack using YAML solution templates.

Using AWS Console:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-create-stack.html


Using AWS CLI:

```
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name myteststack \
  --template-body file:///home/testuser/mytemplate.yaml
```

# To add a tag to a EC2 instance


You must have the AWS CLI installed and configured: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html

Unless otherwise stated, all examples have unix-like quotation rules. These examples will need to be adapted to your terminalâ€™s quoting rules.

```
aws ec2 create-tags \
    --resources i-1234567890abcdef0 --tags Key=ec2scheduler,Value=yes
```
