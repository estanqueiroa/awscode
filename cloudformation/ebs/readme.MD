Description: "Check for Unused EBS Volumes On Daily Basis And Notify Via Email"

WARNING: This solution will implement AWS services which may have associated costs - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK :-)

AWS Services to be created: SNS, Lambda, IAM role, EventBridge.

Based on this blog solution: https://dheeraj3choudhary.com/aws-lambda-and-eventbridge-or-find-unused-ebs-volumes-on-weekly-basis-and-notify-via-email

![Alt text](diagrams/unused-ebs.png?raw=true "Diagram Image")

# How It Works

The Lambda function will scan the AWS account in a daily basis (as per the configured evenbridge scheduler), and send an email notification to the subscribed email address listing the EBS volumes are unused (i.e the EBS volumes not attached to any EC2 instance).

This way, you can verify whether EBS volumes can be deleted or not, to save costs. ItÂ´s recommended to always take volume snapshots before any deletion.

# Prerequisites

1) An Amazon Web Services (AWS) account with privileges to deploy AWS components listed on the solutions.

https://catalog.workshops.aws/cfn101/en-US/prerequisites/account

2) (Optional) Install and configure the AWS CLI version 2 

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html

3) Create CloudFormation (CFN) stack using YAML solution templates.

Using AWS Console:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-create-stack.html


Using AWS CLI:

```
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name myteststack \
  --template-body file:///home/testuser/mytemplate.yaml
```
