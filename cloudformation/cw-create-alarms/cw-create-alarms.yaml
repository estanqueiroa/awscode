        Metadata:
            Intent: This alarm is used to detect high CPU utilization.
            ThresholdJustification: Typically, you can set the threshold for CPU utilization
                to 70-80%. However, you can adjust this value based on your
                acceptable performance level and workload characteristics. For
                some systems, consistently high CPU utilization may be normal
                and not indicate a problem, while for others, it may be cause of
                concern. Analyze historical CPU utilization data to identify the
                usage, find what CPU utilization is acceptable for your system,
                and set the threshold accordingly.

            AlarmName: AWS/EC2 CPUUtilization InstanceId=i-01fcfb64dffcc4b37
            AlarmDescription: This alarm helps to monitor the CPU utilization of an EC2
                instance. Depending on the application, consistently high
                utilization levels might be normal. But if performance is
                degraded, and the application is not constrained by disk I/O,
                memory, or network resources, then a maxed-out CPU might
                indicate a resource bottleneck or application performance
                problems. High CPU utilization might indicate that an upgrade to
                a more CPU intensive instance is required. If detailed
                monitoring is enabled, you can change the period to 60 seconds
                instead of 300 seconds. For more information, see [Enable or

                the alarm is in ALARM state.

            AlarmDescription: "This alarm helps you monitor whether the Amazon EBS volumes
                attached to an instance are reachable and able to complete I/O
                operations. This status check detects underlying issues with the
                compute or Amazon EBS infrastructure such as the following: 1)
                Hardware or software issues on the storage subsystems underlying
                the EBS volumes, 2) Hardware issues on the physical host that
                impact reachability of the EBS volumes, 3) connectivity issues
                between the instance and EBS volumes. When the attached EBS
                status check fails, you can either wait for Amazon to resolve
                the issue, or you can take actions, such as replacing the
                affected volumes or stopping and restarting the instance."
